\section intro Introduction

There are two convenient methods of linking your
programs with the TravelCCM library. The first one employs the \c
`pkg-config' command (see <a href="http://pkgconfig.freedesktop.org/">
http://pkgconfig.freedesktop.org/</a>), whereas the second one uses \c
`travelccm-config' script. These methods are shortly described below.

\section dependencies Dependencies

The TravelCCM library depends on several other C++ components.

\subsection stdairdep StdAir
Among them, as for now, only StdAir has been packaged. The support for StdAir
is taken in charge by a dedicated M4 macro file (namely, <tt>`stdair.m4'</tt>), 
from the configuration script (generated thanks to <tt>`configure.ac'</tt>).

\section pkgconfig Using the pkg-config command

\c `pkg-config' is a helper tool used when compiling applications and
libraries. It helps you insert the correct compiler and linker
options. The syntax of the \c `pkg-config' is as follows:

\code
pkg-config <options> <library_name>  
\endcode

For instance, assuming that you need to compile an TravelCCM based program
<tt>`my_prog.cpp'</tt>, you should use the following command:

\code
g++ `pkg-config --cflags travelccm` -o my_prog my_prog.cpp `pkg-config --libs travelccm`
\endcode  

For more information see the \c `pkg-config' man pages.


\section travelccm_config Using the travelccm-config script

TravelCCM provides a shell script called \c `travelccm-config`, which is
installed by default in \c `$prefix/bin'
(\c `/usr/local/bin') directory. It can be used to simplify
compilation and linking of TravelCCM based programs. The usage of this
script is quite similar to the usage of the \c `pkg-config' command.

Assuming that you need to compile the program \c `my_prog.cpp'
you can now do that with the following command:

\code
g++ `travelccm-config --cflags` -o my_prog_opt my_prog.cpp `travelccm-config --libs`
\endcode

A list of \c `travelccm-config' options can be obtained by typing:

\code
travelccm-config --help
\endcode

If the \c `travelccm-config' command is not found by your shell, you should add
its location \c `$prefix/bin' to the \c PATH environment variable, e.g.:

\code
export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
\endcode


\section autotools M4 macro for the GNU Autotools

A M4 macro file is delivered with TravelCCM, namely `travelccm.m4', which
can be found in, e.g., `/usr/share/aclocal'. When used by a
`configure' script, thanks to he <tt>`AM_PATH_TravelCCM'</tt> macro
(specified in the M4 macro file), the following Makefile variables are
then defined:
- <tt>`TravelCCM_VERSION'</tt> (e.g., defined to 0.23.0)
- <tt>`TravelCCM_CFLAGS'</tt> (e.g., defined to <tt>`-I${prefix}/include'</tt>)
- <tt>`TravelCCM_LIBS'</tt> (e.g., defined to <tt>`-L${prefix}/lib -ltravelccm'</tt>)


\section dynamiclinking Using TravelCCM with dynamic linking

When using static linking some of the library routines in TravelCCM are
copied into your executable program. This can lead to unnecessary
large executables. To avoid having too large executable files you may
use dynamic linking instead. Dynamic linking means that the actual
linking is performed when the program is executed. This requires that
the system is able to locate the shared TravelCCM library file during your
program execution. If you install the TravelCCM library using a non-standard
prefix, the \c `LD_LIBRARY_PATH' environment variable might be used to
inform the linker of the dynamic library location, e.g.:
\code
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<TravelCCM installation prefix>/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
\endcode
