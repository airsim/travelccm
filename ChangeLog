- Open source release
- TravelCCM implements three different algorithms to calculate the travel
  solution matching the best any customer simulated preferences.
  1) PriceOrientedModel: choose the cheapest travel solution within the given
  list of travel solutions.
  2) HardRestrictionModel: choose the cheapest travel solution which satisfies
  the restrictions such as change fees and non refundable.
  3) HybridModel: choose the cheapest travel solution after having added
  disutility values for each unsatisfied restriction.
