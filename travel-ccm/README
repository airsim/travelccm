Building the library and test binary from Subversion repository:
----------------------------------------------------------------
The Sourceforge Subversion repository is to be found here:
svn co https://travel-ccm.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/travel-ccm/trunk/travel-ccm travel-ccmsvn

Then, you need the following packages (Fedora Core 6 names here, 
but names may vary according to distributions):
  * libtool, autoconf, automake
  * gettext-devel
  * gcc-c++
  * boost-devel
  * doxygen
  * tetex-latex (optional)
  * rpm-build (optional)

Building the library and test binary from the tarball:
------------------------------------------------------
The latest stable source tarball (travel-ccm*.tar.gz or .bz2) can be found here:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=261639

Then, as usual, you can just type the following sequence:
"./configure --prefix=/home/travel-ccm/dev/deliveries/travel-ccm-0.1.0 && make && make check"
Of course, if you want to install the library (libtravel-ccm*.so*), 
just type: "make install".

See the INSTALL file for more details.
