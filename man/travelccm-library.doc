	  C++ Travel Customer Choice Model Library

\section sec_synopsis SYNOPSIS

\code
#include <travelccm/...>
\endcode

\section sec_description DESCRIPTION

aims at providing a clean API, and the corresponding 
C++ implementation, for choosing one item among a set of travel solutions,
given demand-related characteristics (e.g., Willingness-To-Pay, preferred
airline, preferred cabin, etc.).

The ${PROJECT_NAME} C++ library implements some simple Customer Choice 
Models (CCM), as referenced in the literature (PhD dissertations at MIT, 
for instance: http://dspace.mit.edu).

The ${PROJECT_NAME} C++ library exposes a simple, clean and object-oriented,
API. For instance, the choose() method takes, as input, both a
structure representing the travel request (e.g., from Washington, DC,
US, to Beijing, China, on the 25th of May) and a list of travel
solutions (as provided by the Airline Schedule Manager project:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/travel-ccm), and yields, as output, the
chosen item.

The output can then be used by other systems, for instance to book the
corresponding travel or to visualise it on a map and calendar and to
share it with others.

${PROJECT_NAME} makes an extensive use of existing open-source libraries for
increased functionality, speed and accuracy. In particular the
Boost (C++ Standard Extensions: http://www.boost.org) library is used.
