- Open source release
- TravelCCM implements three different algorithms to calculate the travel 
  solution matching the best any customer simulated preferences.  
  1) PriceOrientedModel: choose the cheapest travel solution within the given 
  list of travel solutions.
  2) HardRestrictionModel: choose the cheapest travel solution which satisfies 
  the restrictions such as change fees and non refundable.
  3) HybridModel: choose the cheapest travel solution after having added 
  disutility values for each unsatisfied restriction.

* 2011-12-05:
- Version 0.5.3
- [Doc] Improved a little bit the documentation
- [Build] Improved the CMake build framework

- Version 0.5.0
- TravelCCM is able to calculate the travel solution matching the best
  any customer simulated preferences, when faced with any incoming
  booking request, thanks to the batch (airsched). An interactive
  utility has still to be implemented
